#+TITLE: Running IEA-API along with Indy test pool

* Requirements: docker, docker-compose, port 8000

* Clone the repository at https://github.com/ID-Chain/IEA-API.git

* Edit docker-compose.yaml to remove schemac image and associated dependency markers.
  
* Create a .env file by copying the contents of env-example file.

* do `docker-compose up -d` to start the images for the first time.

* Getting the genesis transaction ids
** run `docker ps` to get the container id of the currently running idchain/test-pool image 
** Execute `docker exec <containerId> bash -c 'cat "/home/indy/.indy-cli/networks/$IDC_POOL_NAME/pool_transactions_genesis"' > pool_transactions_genesis`, 
   which puts the information about the genesis transaction onto a file in the project directory
** run `docker-compose restart` to populate the latest values. Wait for a couple minutes and the API docs will be available at http://localhost:8000/api/docs

* Rebuild the `api` container with `docker-compose rebuild api`. This step puts  
  the new genesis_transaction onto the new container.
  
* Now launch everything with `docker-compose up -d`
